## 📍 What is Logic Lab Circuit?

**Logic Lab Circuit** is an educational logic simulator designed to visualize the real-time operation of binary logic gates.  
It helps students understand how gates combine to form digital systems, such as:

- AND, OR, NOT, XOR logic gates  
- Full Adder Circuits  
- Full Subtractor Circuits  
- **Coming Soon:** Step-by-step visual circuit walkthroughs, Binary Multiplication and Division

---
