  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>[Side Project ‚Äì In Progress] Logic Lab Circuit is a Swift-based iOS application designed to help early computer engineering learners visualize and understand the core principles of digital logic. Focused on interactive education, this app simulates how fundamental logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) operate in real time, guiding users through the thought process and how digital systems perform binary operations such as addition (Full Adder Circuit) and subtraction (Full Subtractor Circuit), with multiplication and division modules coming soon.
  </p>
  <h2>Whats's Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    Upcoming features will include playful yet informative simulations for multiplication, division, and bitwise operations. The roadmap also includes visual breakdowns of how modern computers execute multi-bit operations step-by-step, helping learners grasp not just what‚Äôs happening but why and how it works under the hood.
